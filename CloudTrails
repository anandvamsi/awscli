In this exmaple, we will dowload the cloudtrail data from s3 bucket and look for s3 instances that terminated.


step1:-
make sure instances have permission to dowload the logs from s3 bucket- create a role if required.
aws s3 cp s3://my_cloudtrail_bucket/AWSLogs/012345678901/CloudTrail/eu-west-1/2019/08/07 ./ --recursive


step2:-
gzip -d * // will uncompress the logs.
cat * | jq '.Records[] | select(.eventName=="RunInstances")'

step 3:- Looks for Terminated and Stopped instances.
cat * | jq '.Records[] | select(.eventName=="StopInstances" or .eventName=="TerminateInstances" )'
